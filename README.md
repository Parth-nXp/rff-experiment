# rff-experiment
This project demonstrates a simulation of an experiment using Random Fourier Features (RFF) to approximate a non-linear function. The experiment is designed to be repeated multiple times, and the mean squared error (MSE) is calculated and plotted over iterations to evaluate the performance of the model.
